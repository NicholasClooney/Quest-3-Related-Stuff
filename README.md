# APK Extract & Install Toolkit for ADB

Built to simplify the process of sideloading split APKs from Play Store apps

A friendly CLI toolkit that helps you extract APKs from one Android device (like an emulator or BlueStacks) and install them onto another (like your Meta Quest 3).

## üåü Why I Made This

I made this for myself because I want the peace of mind and security of using apps pulled directly from the official Google Play Store, without relying on any third-party APK sites or middlemen. But you're welcome to use it or extend it for your own workflows.

Extracting and sideloading APKs ‚Äî especially split APKs ‚Äî can be a real pain, especially when using emulators like BlueStacks. This tool streamlines that process:

- Manually downloading Android apps with Google Play Store using BlueStacks
- Extracting all split APKs and sideload them onto my Quest 3.
- Bonus: I wanted a reliable CLI interface with good UX ‚Äî helpful messages, automatic folder creation, and clean adb integration.

## üß∞ Enabling Developer Mode on Your Devices

Before using the scripts, make sure both source and target devices have developer mode enabled. I am using BlueStacks as my source device here.

### üîπ BlueStacks (Source Device)

1. Open BlueStacks and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Toggle **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** to **On**.
4. Click **Save changes**.
5. Connect using:
   ```bash
   adb connect localhost:5555
   ```

### üîπ Meta Quest 3 (Target Device)

1. Visit the [Meta Developer Portal](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/) and create an organization.
2. Verify your Meta account (credit card or 2FA).
3. Open the **Meta Quest app** on your phone:
   - Tap **Menu** ‚Üí **Devices** ‚Üí Select your headset
   - Tap **Headset Settings** ‚Üí **Developer Mode**
   - Toggle **Developer Mode** to **On**, then restart your headset

## üöÄ How to Use It

> üí° Tip: Run `adb devices` to list available connected devices and get their IDs for use in the commands below.

### 1. Extract and Install APKs

Use `apk-extract-and-install-with-adb.py` to extract APKs from one device and optionally install to another:

```bash
python apk-extract-and-install-with-adb.py \
  --source-device-id <source-device-id> \
  --target-device-id <target-device-id> \
  --install \
  --verbose \
  --partial-app-name <app-name>
```

This will:

- Search for a package containing "", e.g. `firefox`, on your source device
- Pull all split APKs
- Save them to `~/Documents/APKs/org.mozilla.firefox/`
- Install them to your target device

You‚Äôll be prompted to select a package if multiple matches are found.

### 2. Check If an App Is Installed

Use `check-apk-installed-on-device.py` to check if a device already has an app installed:

```bash
python check-apk-installed-on-device.py \
  --target-device-id <target-device-id> \
  --verbose \
  --print-all \
  --partial-app-name <app-name>
```

### 3. Compare Apps Across Devices

Use `compare-apps-across-devices.py` to compare user-installed apps between two devices and find out what‚Äôs missing or extra.

```bash
python compare-apps-across-devices.py \
  --source-device-id <source-device-id> \
  --target-device-id <target-device-id> \
  --verbose
```

This will:

- Help you identify which apps to extract and install to keep both devices in sync
- List apps installed only on the source (e.g., BlueStacks)
- Optionally list apps installed only on the target (e.g., Quest 3) if you specify `--show-extra-apps-on-target`

---

## üöß How It Works (For the Curious)

- Uses `adb shell pm list packages` and `adb shell pm path` to find and pull APKs.
- Handles split APKs automatically and installs with `adb install-multiple`.
- Prompts you for package selection if fuzzy matching returns more than one result.
- Logs are clean and color-coded (dim adb commands, colored UX prompts).
- All APKs are saved in `~/Documents/APKs/{package.name}/` by default.
